## 📂 Project Structure

-   `src/routes`: Application pages and routing logic.
-   `src/lib`: Shared components (`components/`), stores (`stores.ts`), and utilities (`liturgical.ts`, `i18n/`).
-   `prayers-and-verses`: Centralized repository for all prayer text and scripture translations.
    -   Each language has its own folder (e.g., `en-us/`, `es-mx/`) containing a `constants.ts` file which feeds the UI.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whether it's a new language, a bug fix, or a feature enhancement.

### Adding a New Language

1.  **Create a Folder**: Inside `prayers-and-verses/`, create a new folder for your locale (e.g., `fr-fr`).
2.  **Create Constants**: Create a `constants.ts` file inside that folder. You can copy the structure from `prayers-and-verses/en-us/constants.ts`.
    -   Ensure you implement the `LocalizationData` interface.
    -   Translate all prayers, mysteries, and UI strings.
3.  **Register Locale**: Open `src/lib/i18n/index.ts`:
    -   Import your new constants file.
    -   Add it to the `locales` object exported at the top.
4.  **Test**: Run the app and manually switch the URL to your new locale (e.g., `/fr-fr`) to verify.
